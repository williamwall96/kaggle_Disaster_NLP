# kaggle_Disaster_NLP

## Problem Overview

This project uses data from a Kaggle competition titled "Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets". The challenge is to build a binary text classification model that can predict whether a given tweet is about a real disaster (target = 1) or not (target = 0).

This is a classic problem in Natural Language Processing (NLP) — the field of machine learning that focuses on understanding and generating human language. The task is well-suited for deep learning models such as LSTMs, which can capture sequential patterns in text data.

## Dataset Description

Training data: train.csv — contains both tweet text and the target label.

Test data: test.csv — contains only tweet text; your model predicts the target.

Sample submission: sample_submission.csv — a template for submitting results to Kaggle.
